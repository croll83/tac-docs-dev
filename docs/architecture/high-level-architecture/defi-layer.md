# TAC Ecosystem Layer

The TAC Ecosystem Layer consists of the ecosystem of dApps deployed on TAC and made accessible directly from TON.

As example, the ecosystem will gradually onboard the primitives of decentralized finance applications that we are used to on other EVM chains:

- **Components**:
  - **Liquidity Pools**
  - **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**
  - **Lending Platforms**
  - **ve3,3 and Intent-Based Dexes**
  - **Yield Markets**
  - **ALM (Automatic Liquidity Managers)**
  - **Aggregators**

- **Integration with TAC**:
  - **Cross-Chain Interactions**: Enable users to access DeFi services using their TON wallets.
  - **dApp Proxies**: Facilitate communication between the TON network and DeFi applications on EVM.
