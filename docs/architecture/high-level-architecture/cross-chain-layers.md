# Cross-Chain Layers (TON and EVM Parts)

The cross-chain layers consist of smart contracts responsible for:

- **Execution**: Handling calls, minting, unlocking operations across chains.
- **Data Availability**: Ensuring that transaction data is accessible for verification and execution.
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Facilitating agreement among sequencers and sequencer groups.
- **Elections**: Managing the election and rotation of sequencer groups.

These layers operate on both the TON and EVM sides to enable seamless cross-chain interactions.
