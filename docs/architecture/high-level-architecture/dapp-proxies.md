# DApp Proxies

DApp proxies are lightweight proxy smart contracts for each decentralized application (dApp), deployed on both TVM (TON Virtual Machine) and EVM.

- **Purpose**: They process calls between the execution layer and the dApp on TAC and between the execution layer and the TON wallet on TON.

- **Functionality**:
  - **Interoperability**: Enable TON wallets to interact with EVM-compatible dApps seamlessly.
  - **Security**: Ensure secure communication and transaction execution across chains.
  - **User Experience**: Provide a user-friendly interface for cross-chain interactions.
