# Sequencers Synchronization and Epochs

To ensure seamless cross-chain transactions, proper synchronization of sequencers in a peer-to-peer network is crucial.

## Epoch-Based Approach

Epochs are meticulously structured, with each epoch defined by the formula:

$$
EpochId = \frac{now - protocolDeployDate}{epochDuration}
$$

- **Purpose**: Segments time into discrete intervals, boosting reliability and auditability of transaction records.
- **Sequencer Operation**: Sequencers get transaction log messages on TON (or events on the EVM side) sent on the `CrossChainMessage` smart contract by `Timestamp` value in the timespan determined by:

  $$
  [protocolDeployDate + EpochId \times epochDuration,\quad protocolDeployDate + (EpochId + 1) \times epochDuration]
  $$

## Importance of Synchronization

- **Merkle Proof Alignment**: Without synchronization, the Merkle proofs generated by different sequencers may not align, leading to a lack of consensus.
- **Cross-Chain Coherency**: Misalignment can hinder the coherency and functionality of cross-chain communications.
