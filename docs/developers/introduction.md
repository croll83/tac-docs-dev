# What is TAC

TON App Chain (TAC) is a compatibility layer that connects TON with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), facilitating direct access to EVM-compatible applications in a secure, efficient, and user-friendly manner.

To achieve this, TAC uses a concept called **Proxy Apps**, which are auto-generated proxies deployed on both TON and EVM that allow calling EVM apps using native TON wallets.
